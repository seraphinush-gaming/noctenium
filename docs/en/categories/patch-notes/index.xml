      <description>Developer comment Addition update on new gear release together with a class balance is in preparation. key detail in preparation is, for each class, stat-related passive revision, skill damage and effect adjustment, and select skill revision and addition. through these changes, we hope to match the necessary balance between classes that were not applied in this balance update, so please stay tuned for more information. Update 1. Combat balance  Berserker  Unleash  Unleashed: Sinister, Unleashed: Dexter  Increase skill damage by 20% Changed 폭주 : 강화 효과 stack limit to 7 Changed damage increase per 폭주 : 강화 효과 stack from 5~10% -&amp;gt; 8~14%   Unleashed: Rampage  Changed 야수의 돌진 강화 효과 stack limit to 7 Changed damage increase per 야수의 돌진 강화 효과 stack from 5~10% -&amp;gt; 8~14%   Unleashed: Beast Fury  Changed cooldown duration from 10s -&amp;gt; 8s   Unleash  Increased skill damage by 30%   Cyclone  Changed stagger effect to players to apply on 1st, 2nd, 3rd hit   Bloodlust  Skill level 1  Increased skill damage increase upon successful hit on monsters from 10% -&amp;gt; 12%   Skill level 2  Increased skill damage increase upon successful hit on monsters from 10% -&amp;gt; 15%     Flatten  Increased skill damage by 15%   Vampiric Blow  Increased skill damage by 15%   Tackle  Increased skill damage by 20%        Developer comment Unleash-related skill and Bloodlust skill adjustments - Regarding the Berserker class, we realized there was a risk due to the lack of utility while using Unleash, especially in the current meta where frequency repositioning is necessary.</description>

      <description>Update 1. Dungeon  Adjusted Harrowhold balance.  Phase 3  Increased Vergoth defense Increased center breathe damage Increased HP of attribute sphere Increased attribute sphere explosion damage Increased HP of shield for all body parts Increased periodic damage of lava puddle Increased defense upon burn phase      Developer&#39;s comment - We have confirmed that phase 3 severely lacks difficulty. Because of this, clearing phase 3 has become meaningless, and it does not accomplish its role as a bridge to phase 4, and thus the difficulty of the phase was significantly increased.</description>

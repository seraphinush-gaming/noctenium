      <description>Update 1. Balance (added Developer comment)  Slayer  Added chains to use [Whirlwind], [Heart Thrust], and [Knockdown Strike] after Savage Strike Changed chance to proc Aggression talent level 1 to level 20 from [22-34%] to [22-60%]    Developer comment - 무사의 경우 괴력 특성의 발동 확률이 낮아 관련 특성을 최대 단계로 올려도 효과를 제대로 받기 어려운 문제가 있었습니다. 따라서, 괴력 발동 확률을 상향 조정하여 특성 효과를 보다 잘 활용할 수 있도록 하였습니다.</description>

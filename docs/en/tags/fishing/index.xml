      <description>Fishing is a casual open world activity. In order to catch fish, Bait and Fishing Rod are necessary. Both can be purchased with Gold from a [Fishing Supplies] merchant, and higher grade Fishing Rods and Baits can be exchanged with Angler Tokens from an [Angler Token Vendor].
[Fishing Supplies] merchant and [Angler Token Vendor] are located at fisheries and major cities.
Fish caught can be delivered to select NPCs for Gold or goods, or can be dismantled to obtain Fish Filet (Arborean Fish) or Kirash Filet (Exodor Fish) which can be used as Cooking materials.</description>

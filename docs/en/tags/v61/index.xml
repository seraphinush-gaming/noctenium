      <description>Update 1. Dungeon  Decreased difficulty of Thaumetal Refinery (hard)  Decreased damage of certain skills for each boss Increased stun duration of 1st boss after tackling tree Decreased penalty / damage of explosive goblins during 3rd boss    Developer comment (paraphrased; point form) - Too many players were trying to take advantage of the market by obtaining tradeable items from Entropic / Metamorphic Emblem and eventually trading Gold for real money so they changed items to be untradeable.</description>

      <description>Update 1. Dungeon  Sky Cruiser Endeavor  Decreased the HP of mobs for 1st boss Significantly decreased the HP of 2nd and 3rd boss   Nightmare Lilith&amp;rsquo;s Keep  Significantly decreased the HP of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd boss   Harrowhold  Reoponed 20-Person raid Harrowhold Teleportal is located at Velika Outskirts Harrowhold does not support IMS Harrowhold proceeds through 4 phases, rewarding loot per phase (same conditions apply to looting)    Reward change comment Despite our intention for unskilled new and returning players to be self-sufficient through solo contents, it seems as though players were forced to harvest enchanting materials from multiple characters for one character.</description>

      <description>+ : Suggestion accepted / in progress in the same or alternative form ? : Suggestion in review - : Suggestion rejected System / UI + Suggestion to revise crafting time depending on item crafted 예전에는 제작 속도를 빠르게 해주는 아이템들이 있었으나, 현재는 구입처가 마땅하지 않은 것이 사실입니다.

      <description>+ : Suggestion accepted / in progress in the same or alternative form ? : Suggestion in review - : Suggestion rejected System / UI + Suggestion to add a Game Guide for new players 테라의 서비스 기간이 길어지다 보니, 각종 시스템과 컨텐츠의 복잡도가 높아지고 있는게 사실입니다. 특히나 신규 및 복귀로 테라를 플레이하고 계신 수호자님들께는 정보 획득이 또 하나의 허들이 될 수도 있을 것으로 생각합니다.
개발진은 이러한 정보의 불균형을 해소하기 위해 게임을 플레이하면서 자연스럽게 필요한 정보를 습득하고 안내 받을 수 있는 통합 가이드시스템을 개발 중에 있습니다.</description>

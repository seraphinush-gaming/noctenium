      <description>Kaia&amp;rsquo;s gear is the retool for Annihilation / Dark Light gear, added v91. It is the first of the Mythic rarity gear, which therefore termed itself to be generally known as Mythical gear. It is available at all enchantment levels of Annihilation / Dark Light gear, and enchanting is still available after upgrading to Mythical gear.
One core equipment is necessary to retool superior Exodor gear into Mythical gear, which can be either a Black Core Essence, or Heroic Oath gear.</description>

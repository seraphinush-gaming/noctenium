In the past, Companions were simply Pets that you can summon from your Skill UI. From v81 with the addition of Partners and onward, both are accessed from the Companion UI. Pets that have special Abilities can perform tedious tasks such as looting drop items, looting gold, gathering resources, or providing extra storage.</description></item></channel></rss>

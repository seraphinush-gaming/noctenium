- 던전 및 보상 개편 업데이트 이후 상위 던전의 클리어 난이도에 대한 지속적인 피드백을 확인하였고, 약 1주간의 상위 던전에서의 사망 횟수 및 클리어율 확인 결과 난이도가 예상보다 높음을 확인하였습니다. 이를 통해 던전 패턴의 난이도 자체를 하향하는 것 보다는 전멸이 발생할 만한 요인에 대해 우선적으로 완화하였으며, 오샤르 비용을 하향 조정하여 상위 던전 트라이에 부담을 줄이고자 하였습니다.
- 추가적으로 65레벨 이상 던전에서 드랍되는 아르보레아의 숨결 상자는 매우 낮은 확률로 던전에서 드랍되어 희귀한 가치를 가지는 보상 아이템이나, 현재 최초 기획 의도보다 많은 양의 아이템이 드랍되고 있는 것으로 확인되어 확률을 하향 조정하였습니다.

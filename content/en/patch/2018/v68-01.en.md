Developer comment

- In accordance to adding new dungeons without retiring old dungeons, rewards for existing dungeons have been adjusted with the addition of new dungeons (Red Refuge, Red Refuge (hard)). loot has been evenly distributed, and changed Vanguard Initiative bonus reward to gems in order to obtain both gold and enchanting materials appropriately. Through this redistribution of rewards, more can be obtained by playing various dungeons and less can be obtained by playing select few dungeons. we will continue to observe and adjust in order to prevent both new and old dungeons from being neglected.

- 전장 운영시간이 확장되고 포화의 전장이 20인으로 업데이트되었습니다. 기다림 없는 '원활한 매칭'이라는 목표로 운영시간과 일부 전장의 개편이 진행되었었는데, 목표와는 별개로 본연의 재미가 떨어졌다는 점을 인지하여 추가 업데이트를 진행하게 되었습니다. 많은 수호자분들이 보다 재미있게 전장 콘텐츠를 즐길 수 있도록 더욱더 노력하겠습니다.

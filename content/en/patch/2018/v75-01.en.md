Developer comment

- 기존 스킬과 관련하여 [신월: 달빛의 공명]의 경우 사용 횟수는 적은 반면 DPS에서 차지하는 비중이 지나치게 높아, 이 스킬을 사용하지 않는 구간에 전투의 재미가 떨어지는 문제를 보완하고자 하였습니다.
- [신월: 달빛의 공명]의 위력을 극대화 시킬 수 있던 몇몇 문장 효과를 수정하여 위력을 약화시켰습니다. 대신, 재사용 대기시간을 감소시킴과 동시에 각성 스킬 [광폭창술]을 통해 신월을 더 자주 사용할 수 있도록 하였습니다.
- 또한, 월광흔을 쌓는 기본 스킬들의 위력을 상승시켰으며 문장을 통해 치명타 확률 및 스킬 위력을 보완할 수 있도록 문장 소모 포인트를 조정하였습니다.

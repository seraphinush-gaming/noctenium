## Update

### **1.** Balance
- Adjusted to increase XP on ilvl 412-456 dungeon bosses
  - Changed XP ranges differently per dungeon
- Decreased XP required to level up between level 66-70

```
Developer comment

- First off we increased XP earned through dungeons by 3 times through this maintenance. 
- The XP gain has been adjusted using difficulty and clear time as basis, and therefore each each dungeon provides a different amount of XP.
- We are looking into more ways to provide XP.
```

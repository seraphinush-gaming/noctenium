Developer comment

- 장비레벨 439 던전에서 특정 던전에만 이용률이 치중되어 있는 것이 확인 되어 던전의 난이도 하향과 함께 보상을 변경하였습니다. 차가운 금속 장비 강화 재료들을 특정 던전에서만 얻을 수 있도록 분배한 대신, 보상의 총량을 늘려 여러 던전을 이용할 경우 이전보다 많은 보상을 얻을 수 있도록 변경하였습니다.

- 장비레벨 446이상 던전에서 드랍되는 상급 강화 재료 상자는 차가운 금속 장비 강화 재료가 주로 나오고 있으나 대부분의 수호자분들에게는 해당 아이템의 공급량이 과도하여 이를 해결하고자 드랍 보상에서 관련 강화 재료를 제거하고 그만큼 지령서 골드 보상을 상향하여 보상 총량을 보존하였습니다.

우편으로 재지급 해드렸습니다. (서버별 점검 전 최근 접속한 캐릭터의 우편으로 지급)

```
Developer comment

- 초과 지급된 모든 보상에 대해 즉시 회수를 진행하고자 하였지만, 작업 도중 문제가 발생하여 당일은 우편에 대해서만 회수가 진행되었습니다. 용맹의 물약 II, [이벤트] 양 불고기 등 모든 초과 지급된 보상을 회수할 경우, 보다 장시간의 점검이 필요하여 순위기록과 밸런스에 영향도가 큰 초콜릿에 대해서만 회수를 결정하였습니다. 위 문제로 혼란을 드려 죄송합니다. 이후에는 이런 일이 없도록 노력하겠습니다.

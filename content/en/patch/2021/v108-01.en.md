Developer comment

<Piercing / Ignore option balance adjustment>
Current damage meta is biased towards Amplification and Crit Power increase preventing players from pursuing a variety of options. therefore, we deemed it was necessary to increase the efficiency of Piercing and Ignore option and changed how piercing / ignore option is applied. 앞으로는 대미지 증가에 기여하는 여러 옵션들이 균등한 가치를 가질 수 있게 밸런스를 조절해 나갈 예정입니다.

Developer comment

<Unleashed : Leaping Strike skill addition>
Regarding the Berserker class, there was an issue dealing with boss attacks that cannot be iframed. with this in mind, a new movement skill was added to use during Unleash to be able to deal with such attacks. in addition, the new skill can be chained to quickly reposition and continue with the barrage.
 
<Passive effect revision>
Regarding Heavy Bleeding passive, there was an issue where passive efficiency was relatively lower than other class passives. with this in mind, additional skills were added to take effect from the passive as well as adjust the skill damage increase factor, to increase passive efficiency and balance between skills.
 
<Sweeping Strike skill type change>
Regarding Sweeping Strike, while the skill could have been used to diminish performance loss when used after having forced to iframe while charging, there was an issue where it was not utilize due to the skill being applied as Magical damage. with this in mind, the skill was changed to apply as Physical damage in hope to revise its utility.
```

- Warrior
  - Fatal Wound (passive)
    - Changed passive effect to 'Increase Ignore Physical Resistance based on Physical Crit Power'
    - Ignore Physical Resistance is increased by 15,000 per 1 Physical Crit Power

Developer comment

Developer comment

<Passive effect revision>
Regarding Spell Aria passive, there was an issue where passive efficiency was relatively lower than other class passives. with this in mind, additional skills were added to take effect from the passive as well as adjust the skill damage increase factor, to increase passive efficiency and balance between skills.

Developer comment

<Rapid Fire skill structural revision>
Previously, due to the structural design of having to activate multiple times during a short time span there was an issue where the skill was overly influenced by network and environment as Attack Speed increased. with this in mind, the skill was revised to shoot multiple arrows when skill is cast to minimize environmental influence.
 
<Utility performance revision>
Regarding the Archer class there was a necessity to utilize Breakaway Bolt as an iframe in order to maximize performance, but unfortunately the iframe duration was short and did not activate immediately while the previous skill was casting. with this in mind, iframe duration and allowed chain cast point was adjusted to increase the utility of said skill. in addition, to emphasize its use as an iframe, the Glyph of Powerlink [Penetrating Arrow] was transferred to Sequential Fire.
 
<Passive effect revision>
Regarding the Archer class we deemed that it was necessary to increase the overall attack performance of the class, and proceeded to adjust to increase select passive effect.
```

- Lancer
  - Divine Protection
    - Increased damage absorption by up to 100% based on Physical Resistance

Developer comment

<Divine Protection absorption revision>
각성 업데이트 이후, 캐릭터 및 몬스터의 피해량과 HP가 지속적으로 증가되었지만, 천상의 방패의 보호량은 증가하지 않아 스킬의 위상이 상대적으로 낮아지는 문제가 있었습니다. 따라서, 스킬 위상이 일정 수준으로 유지될 수 있도록 창기사의 주요 스탯에 비례하여 보호량이 증가하도록 개선하였습니다.
 
<전투의 의지, 신뢰의 오라 재사용 대기시간 조정>
딜러 클래스가 버프 스킬을 쿨타임 마다 즉시 활용하는 메타로 변화되면서, 조금 더 긴 쿨타임을 갖는 창기사의 버프 스킬을 이에 맞게 활용하기 어려워졌습니다. 따라서, 파티원과의 조율을 통해 딜러 클래스의 버프 스킬 사용 시점에 맞춰 활용할 수 있도록 창기사의 주요 파티 버프 쿨타임을 조정 하였습니다.
```

```
Developer comment

<Hit range revision>
선인화 상태에서 발동되는 부메랑 수리검 및 폭염술의 타격 범위가 넓게 분산 되어있어, 상대적으로 크기가 작은 보스에게 일부 타격이 적중 되지 않는 문제가 있었습니다. 보스의 크기에 따라 해당 스킬의 효율이 낮아지는 것은 불합리한 부분이라고 판단되어, 해당 스킬의 타격 범위 조정을 통해 보스 몬스터 크기에 크게 영향 받지 않도록 개선하였습니다.

Developer comment

<Retribution skill utility revision>
기존 반격 스킬의 경우 반격 발동 실패에 대한 리스크가 크고 반격에 성공 하더라도, 빠르게 다음 공격 스킬을 이어 나갈 수 없어 활용성이 좋지 못했습니다. 반격 후 스킬 연계 루트를 확장하고 역습 사용 조건을 완화하여 전투 중 반격 및 역습을 보다 적극적으로 활용할 수 있도록 하였습니다.

Developer comment

```
Developer comment

Unleash-related skill and Bloodlust skill adjustments
- Regarding the Berserker class, we realized there was a risk due to the lack of utility while using Unleash, especially in the current meta where frequency repositioning is necessary. with this in mind, the purpose of the above adjustments was to leverage some of the risks and reinforce. in addition, a new movement skill will be added in a future update in order to be able to adjust to the current meta better.

Flatten, Vampiric Blow, Tackle adjustments
- Skill damage increase adjustments were focused on skills that have low usage relative to other main skills in order to gradually even out balance between skills.

Cyclone adjustments on stagger effect against players
- Due to the constant stagger effect applied from repeated usage of Cyclone, it makes it hard for players to deal with, allowing the user to take control of the area quite easily. therefore, we hope that removing the stagger effect on the last hit will give other players room to react.

또한 향후 업데이트에서 패시브 및 스킬 조정을 통해 스텟을 통한 성장 체감이 보다 잘 발생하도록 개선될 예정입니다.
```

- Warrior

    - Changed skill damage increase against monsters to apply to all skills, and adjusted to decrease skill damage increase from 12% -> 5%
  - Tempest Aura
    - Increased skill damage increase effect from 10% -> 15% during Shadow of the Tempest I
  - Blade Frenzy
    - Increased skill damage by 10%
    - Decreased skill damage by 10% to players
  - Backstab
    - Decreased duration of stun applied to players by half while in Defensive Stance
  - Assault Stance
    - Changed skill damage increase against monsters from 10% -> 20%
    - Changed Endurance decrease from 10% -> 20%
  - Enhanced Defensive Stance (passive)
    - Changed skill damage increase against monsters from 8% -> 13% while in Defensive Stance

```
Developer comment

Stat increase skill effect and Blade Frenzy skill damage adjustment
- Regarding the Warrior class, we felt that they were slightly weaker in boss fights compared to other classes, and was difficult to see the effect from the key passive skill. through this update we adjusted select skill effects to increase the overall dps against monsters. 차후 업데이트에서는 스텟을 통한 성장 체감이 보다 잘 발생할 수 있도록 치명상 패시브의 개선이 이루어질 예정입니다.

Backstab stun duration adjustment
- While in Warrior's Defensive Stance, players can easily chain the long stun status displaying a strong stance in a 1:1 situation. therefore, we hope that decreasing the stun duration will give other players room to react.
```

- Sorcerer
  - Ice Lance
    - Increased skill damage by 20%
    - Changed skill damage increase from successful hit with Arcane Pulse, Nova from 30% -> 10%
  - Elemental Attunement
    - Changed skill damage increase of Flame, Frost, Arcane Attack from 4% -> 15%
    - Changed Equipoise effect to Elementalist effect
      - Elementalist effect activates upon using Fusion skill of two elements
      - Increases damage of Fusion skills of two elements by 20% while in Elementalist effect

```
Developer comment

Ice Lance, Fusion enhancement requirement and passive effect adjustment
- Regarding the Sorcerer class, we felt that they were slightly weaker in boss fights compared to other classes, and especially difficult for players with low proficiency. with this in mind, adjusting skill requirements of skills that require high proficiency will close the class proficiency gap, and strengthening the passive effect will increase the overall dps. 향후 업데이트에서는, 패시브 및 스킬 조정을 통해 스텟을 통한 성장체감이 보다 잘 발생하도록 개선될 예정입니다.
```

- Archer
  - Sequential Fire
    - Decrease cooldown duration from 5 -> 3
    - Changed Glyph of Chance (common) of Glyph of Power (common)
      - Glyph of Power (common)
        - Increase skill damage by 20%

```
Developer comment

Regarding the archer class discomfort due to Rapid Fire cutting short has been consistently occuring. this has been confirmed to be a structural issue, and we are preparing to make revisions in a future update. through this update we hoped to lower class complexity by making it easier to use without having to check for Sequential Fire cooldown reset.
```

- Slayer
  - Propulsion
    - Changed to decrease cooldown of Measured Slice by 1.5 seconds, even after a successful hit of Eviscerate

```
Developer comment

Propulsion passive requirement adjustment
- The existing 'decrease cooldown of Measured Slice after a critical hit of Eviscerate' effect is a big factor in affecting class complexity, due to skill rotation change on whether or not a critical hit is activated. in order to decrease class complexity, the effect's requirement was adjusted to focus more on [] than the target's action during combat.
```

- Reaper
  - Bug fixes
    - Fixed issue where Shadow Reaping effect and Lein's Dark Root Beer effect stacked
  - Binding Scythes
    - Changed final hit damage time from 10s -> 5s, after binding
    - Mastery: Binding Scythes : Changed Binding Scythes stack limit from 50 -> 25
    - Mastery: Binding Scythes : Changed Binding Scythes stack from 2% -> 4%
    - Increased continuous damage applied to binded target by 2 times
    - Changed cooldown from 5min -> 4min
    - Decreased final hit skill damage by 15%

```
Developer comment

Binding Scythes usage, and cooldown, skill damage adjustment
- Skill complexity was high due to the long period to apply damage and the number of successful hits to make in order to utilize 100% of the skill, and difficulty to use properly depending on the boss monster's mechanics. with this in mind, the final hit damage time and effect was adjusted to make it easier to utilize the skill than before, upon choosing the right time to cast. in addition, cooldown duration was adjusted in order to help match Binding Scythes usage with other key buffs. however, as Reapers are already displaying an outstanding performance the skill damage was adjusted as well.
```

- Valkyrie
  - Twilight Waltz
    - Removed (Armorbreak) endurance decrease effect on target
  - Glaive Strike
    - Increased skill damage by 10%
  - Ground Bash
    - Increased skill damage by 15%
  - Dreamblaze (passive)
    - Changed Dreamblaze stack limit from 4 -> 2
    - Changed Runeburst skill damage increase from 10% -> 20% per stack
    - Increased Magic Amplification-based effect increase by 2 times
    - Changed passive requirement skill [Shining Crescent] to [Dream Slash]

```
Developer comment

Synergetic dps role reduction
- The synergetic dps concept through Armorbreak effect on Twilight Waltz does not trigger a meaningful play in the current meta, and taking in the fact that party clear times were relatively faster with a Valkyrie in the party, we decided to remove Armorbreak effect and increase Valkyrie performance in turn. Notably, Dreamblaze passive effect and skill damage of Glaive Strike, Ground Bash was adjusted to make non-ultimate duration play be more meaningful than before.
```

- Ninja
  - Harmonious Burning Heart
    - Fixed character attack and clone attack to no longer stack
      - Fixed character-based Burning Heart skill damage and clone-based Burning Heart skill damage to be the same
      - Changed maximum hit count to 11, adjusted skill damage upon all successful hit to be the same as the Harmonious Burning Heart skill damage upon all successful hit before this update
    - Decreased damage to players by 1/3
    - Changed skill hit box
    - Fixed issue where skill damage was noted to be lower than the actual value

```
Developer comment

Harmonious Burning Heart hit method adjustment
- Regarding Harmonious Burning Heart, discomfort due to clone-based Burning Heart missing hits depending on the size of the target has been occuring. with this in mind, hit method has been revised to not be altered depending on the size of the target, and effectively hit from a distance. however, as it become much easier to target, damage to players has been adjusted to prevent damage excessively.
```

- Berserker
  - Triumphant Shout
    - Changed knockdown, stagger, and movement-disabling effect resistance duration from 5s -> 3s
- Archer
  - Tenacity
    - Changed movement-disabling effect resistance duration from 5s -> 3s
- Slayer
  - Tenacity
    - Changed movement-disabling effect resistance duration from 5s -> 3s
    - Skill Optimization - ''
      - Changed additional effect duration from 5s -> 3s
    - Skill Optimization - ''
      - Resistance to movement-disabling effect no longer applies upon choosing '' Skill Optimization

```
Developer comment

Triumphant Shout, Tenacity skill effect adjustment
- We noticed Triumphant Shout, Tenacity that uptime was high during combat, leaving little time for the opponent to react and diminished the urgency combat should have. with this in mind, effect duration was adjusted to make exchanges with the opponent more frequent by being more vigilant in using the above skills.
- Regarding the Slayer class, an upperhand was easily gained in combat against players through various effects received from '' Skill Optimization (immunity, status resistance, and status removal). therefore, for choosing '' Skill Optimization for PVP means, the effect was adjusted to select few effects.
```

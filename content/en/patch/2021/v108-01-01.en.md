Developer comment

마흐트난 장비의 기본 스펙을 상승시키고, 해방된 카이아 장비에서 준 필수 옵션들을 계승하였습니다.
매 강화 단계 별로 능력치가 크게 성장하게 하여 성장 체감을 강화했고, 등급에 따라 Crit Factor이 크게 증가하게 하여 무기 외 방어 장비의 등급을 유지해야할 필요성을 높였습니다.
```

Stormed Citadel의 경우 피드백 및 지표 모니터링을 통해 패턴 추가 개선을 예정하고 있습니다. 던전 내 기믹 조절과 밸런스 이슈 등을 잘 검토하고 다른 문제가 발생하지 않도록 작업을 진행해야 하기에 추가 패턴 개선이 이번 업데이트에 포함 되지 않는 점 양해 바랍니다.

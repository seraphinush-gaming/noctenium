Developer comment

-사제의 경우, [천벌의 연쇄 – 약화의 문장]의 효과 지속시간이 짧은 관계로 너무 잦은 빈도로 신경 써야만 하는 상황이었습니다. 따라서 지속시간을 상향 조정하였습니다.
-심판의 주문 사용 후, 아군에게 적용되는 HP 회복량이 너무 낮아 파티가 위험할 때 심판의 주문을 해제한 후 회복 스킬을 사용해야만 했습니다. 따라서 심판의 주문 상태에서도 어느 정도 파티원 HP 관리가 가능하도록 심판의 손길 HP 회복량을 상향하였습니다.
-평정의 가호는 HP의 20%를 회복시키는 스킬이지만, 의도와 다르게 너무 과도한 HP를 회복시키고 있었습니다. 따라서 즉시 대량의 HP를 회복하고 5초 동안 소량의 HP를 회복하도록 조정하였습니다. 또한 위험한 상황에서 빠르게 사용하실 수 있도록 시전 시간을 1.5초에서 즉시 시전으로 변경하였습니다.

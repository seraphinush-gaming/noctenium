Developer comment

- 신의 숨결과 찬란한 섬광 스킬의 치명타 발생 확률을 조정합니다.
- '신의 숨결' 스킬의 경우 치명타 발생률이 상향되며, 치명타 유발 능력치에 대한 의존도를 낮춰 다른 능력치에 투자할 수 있도록 조정됩니다. 더불어 '찬란한 섬광' 스킬의 치명타 배율이 하향됩니다. 기존 설정된 수치는 의도된 수치 이상으로 매우 높게 설정되었기에 적절한 수준으로 조절됩니다.
- '치유의 바람' 스킬 연계의 난이도를 하향했습니다.
- 특정 스킬 이후에 '치유의 바람' 스킬을 연계하려면 즉시 연계를 통해서만 가능했으며 이는 의도했던 상황보다 더 높은 조작 숙련도를 요구했다고 판단했습니다.
- 이번 조정을 통해 스킬 사용 후 파티원을 향해 짧은 시간 동안 이동하여 강력한 치유의 바람을 사용하실 수 있도록 개선됩니다.

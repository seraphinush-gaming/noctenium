**Pets** and **Partners** together are called Companions, and are support creatures players can summon to help you with your gameplay. In the past, Companions were simply Pets that you can summon from your Skill UI. From v81 with the addition of Partners and onward, both are accessed from the Companion UI. Pets that have special **Abilities** can perform tedious tasks such as looting drop items, looting gold, gathering resources, or providing extra storage. Pet Skills and their description is of the following :

| Ability | Description |
| :-: | :-: |
| Auto-Caring | Use a pet food or present when your pet's Energy / Stamina drops below the percentage indicated. Use the Auto-Caring % button in the Companion List to adjust your pet's settings |
| Auto-Gather | Gathers all gathering objects around you. Consumes 20% fewer production points. RIncreases gathering speed |
| Auto-Gold-Loot | Loots all gold around you |
| Auto-Loot | Loots all items around you |
| Auto-Potion (HP) I~IV | Automatically uses a [Minor, Major, Prime] Recovery Potable or Health Potion when your HP drops to a certain amount |
| Auto-Potion (MP) I~IV | Automatically uses a [Minor, Major, Prime] Replenishment Potable or Divine Infusion when your MP drops to a certain amount |
| Auto-Use Potion | Automatically uses Health Potions or Divine Infusions when your HP or MP drops to the designated percentage. Can be accessed through the Potion button in the Companion List |
| BAF Auto-Fishing | Adds a chance to catch a BAF when you are Auto-Fishing. Increases max Energy/Stamina by 20% |
| Special Storage | Access your pet's special storage. [Caution] Can only access when possessing a pet with the corresponding ability |

Pets can grow and level up by feeding them a big variety of items including Talents, Feedstock, Gear and various food items among many others. Once a Pet grows to Level 10, it can use an **Evolution Core** to evolve into a random Partner. Two Pets can also be **combined** to become a random Pet, or even a random Partner at a low chance. The higher the grades of the Pets, the more likely it is for the two to be combined into a Partner. Note that combining two Grade 10 Pets is guaranteed to yield a random Partner. Evolving or Combining Pets will lose their Pet Skills. Probability of obtaining a Partner of a certain rarity has been modified in v104.01.02 patch notes, leaning towards higher rarity.

**Partners** are specialized Companions. What makes Partners most valuable is their **Bond Skill**, which provides valuable combat support. Partners also have one random passive skill called **Gifted Skill** that can be triggered randomly depending on how much Stamina the Partner has. Partners can **Train** to take and learn Pet Skills from different Companions, so make sure to take Pet Skills from Pets before Evolving or Combining Pets.

Partners start at Grade 1 and Fellowship 1 and can be **Promoted** by consuming another Partner. Promoting a Partner increases its Grade by 1, and improves Fellowship by a random value. Partners cannot go past Grade 10, and therefore can only be promoted 9 times.

At level 66, you can get your first Partner from **Hatching a Partner** quest given by Loomey the Wanderering Scholar in Highwatch. While the obtained Partner does not gain more Fellowship from being Promoted, it can be used to promote another Partner.

## Fellowship
Fellowship is what determines how effective your Partner's **Bond Skill** is. By promoting your Partner, Fellowship of your Partner will increase. While Fellowship caps at 50, the amount of Fellowship increased at each Promotion varies depending on the Grade of the sacrificed Partner.

(Edited v103.01) The obtained Fellowship for a Partner is of the following :

| Partner grade | Fellowship gained |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1-2 | 3-4 |
| 3-4 | 4-5 |
| 5-7 | 4-6 |
| 8-10 | 5-6 |

While dependent on RNG, it is highly recommended to Promote a Partner sacrificing Grade 8 or higher Partners in order to maximize the potential Fellowship gain. Promoting a Partner with Grade 8 Partners guarantee 46 Fellowship.

For an uncommon Partner, 39 Fellowship is the minimum to maintain Bond Skill indefinitely, whereas for Rare and Superior Partner, 37 and 35 Fellowship is the minimum, respectively.

## Bond skill : Power
Select Partners can provide **Power** for their Bond Skill. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high the Partner's Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Four Partners -- **Marie**, **Kuncun**, **Cocomin**, and **Loo** -- have been released to have **Bracing Force** as their Bond Skill, which increases Power for a set duration of time.

The obtained Power and its duration for a Partner of Uncommon, Rare, and Superior rarity is of the following :

![1]

## Bond skill : Amplification
Select Partners can provide **Amplification** for their Bond Skill. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high the Partner's Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Two Partners -- **Rico**  and **Eco** -- have been released to have **Robust Energy** and **Vibrant Energy** as their Bond Skill, which increases Physical Amplification and Magical Amplication (respectively) for a set duration of time.

The obtained Physical / Magical Amplification and its duration for a Partner of Uncommon, Rare, and Superior rarity is of the following :

![2]

## Special Partners

![icon_02]

Special Superior Partners have been added to the game, providing **Eternal Force** for their Bond Skill. Depending on how high the Partner's Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Three Partners -- **RK-9**, **Kalligar**  and **Lumikan** -- have been released to have **Eternal Force** as their Bond Skill, which increases Power for a set duration of time. Unlike Bracing Force, Eternal Force persists through death, meaning the Bond Skill does not expire upon death. 

Please refer to Bracing Force table for the obtained Power and its duration for these Special Partners.

## Gifted Skill

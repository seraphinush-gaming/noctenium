Mahtnan gear is the new gear set added v108, as part of a new season of TERA, namedly TERA : AWAKE. 

Mahtnan gear differentiates itself from the previous Kaia's Soul gear set by removing damage on enchant, and Infusion options. This makes it one of the easiest gear set to enchant due to the removal of artificial enchanting difficulty, but other factors have been added to make Mahtnan gear just as problematic as it was before.

Mahtnan gear is divided into 3 rarities : **Rare**, **Superior**, and **Mythical**, and enchantment is available up to +12.

There is no upgrade to Mahtnan gear, but the newly added Transfer system allows players to transfer enchantment level, Random Options, and Etching from one gear to another.

Mahtnan gear has 3 types of options : Standard Option, Random Option, and **Support Option**.

## Support Option
Support Option are new additions to gear options. Support Option is further divided into **Unique Option** and **Support Random Option**. Different from regular Random Option, Support Option cannot be changed. Support Random Options also have relatively higher values than regular Random Options.

Mystery Merchant is an NPC that sells goods in exchange for special currency called **Mystery Merchant Coin**. For the sake of simplicity, there are two different types of merchants: **City Merchant** and **Wandering Merchant**.

### City Merchant 

![1]

City Merchants are merchants located specific in the 4 major cities : Velika, Allemantheia, Kaiator, and Highwatch. City Merchant locations are marked on the minimap, making them easy to find. A global system message -- that **Mystery Merchant Starc** has appeared in one of the 4 major cities -- signals that the City Merchant associated to the city will open in 5 minutes. City Merchants remain open for 2 hours.
 
![2]

```
Changelog :

- v108.02 : Changed to spawn in channel 1 only
- v106.02 : Changed to spawn in all channels
```

### Wandering Merchant
Wandering Merchants are merchants that spawn in various locations across Arborea. Different from City Merchants, spawn locations vary per region, and requires players to search for the merchant in potential spawn locations. Wandering merchants generally spawn around Camps across the map, but there are many exceptions, notably merchants that spawn in city outskirts where there are no camps, and Northern Shara.

Wandering Merchants spawn for 30 minutes before despawning.

Wandering Merchants do not appear on Stepstone Isle and in Exodor.

| Island of Dawn | Vardung |
| Velika Outskirts | Veracun |

```

```

### Mystery Merchant : Starc
Starc is a special Wandering Merchant that sells Mystery Merchant Coins. Starc spawns 5 minutes before a City Merchant opens, and the merchant's spawn is announced by a global system message. Mystery Merchant Coin costs 3,210 Gold each, and is **account-base limited** to 3 Mystery Merchant Coins.

```

## Spawn Mechanism
City Merchant and Wandering Merchants spawn mechanism varies by region and region sets.

### City Merchant

City Merchants open every 24 hours, and City Merchants rotate every 6 hours. In other words, one of four City Merchant opens every 6 hours. For instance, if City Merchant in Allemantheia opens at 12:00 then merchant reopens 12:00 the next day. Within the same context, if City Merchant in Allemantheia opens at 12:00 then City Merchant in Highwatch opens 6 hours later at 18:00, and so on at 24:00, then 06:00. The city rotation order is Allemantheia, Highwatch, Velika, and finally Kaiator.

### Wandering Merchant

Wandering Merchants spawn in rotation around **region sets**, with exceptions. Region sets are of the following :

![4]

|| Spawn region set |
| :-: | :-: |
| 1 | Arcadia, Val Aureum |
| 2 | Poporia, Ostgarath |
| 3 | Essenia, Westonia |
| 4 | Val Palrada, Val Elenium, Veritas District |
| 5 | Slyvanoth, Lorcada |
| 6 | Val Tirkai, Helkan District, Val Kaeli |

Wandering Merchant for each region set spawns every 6 hours, and for each region set, a random region from the region set is selected for the Wandering Merchant to spawn in. For example, if Wandering Merchant Arcun is about to spawn in region set 1, then said Wandering Merchant can spawn in either Arcadia or Val Aureum, but not both. In the same context, Arcun can spawn in region set 1 again in 6 hours, again in either Arcadia or Val Aureum.

Wandering Merchants spawn rotating through region sets 1-6 in order. That is, Wandering Merchant Foretta or Eteral, which spawns in region set 2, will not spawn before Wandering Merchant Arcun or Viadu, which spawns in region set 1. This applies to Wandering Merchants of other region sets as well. In other words, if Wandering Merchant of region set 1 spawns, then the next Wandering Merchant to appear will be from region set 2, and so on.

Wandering Merchant spawns 20 minutes after the Wandering Merchant of the previous region set despawns. For instance, 20 minutes after Mystery Merchant Arcun (region set 1) despawns, Mystery Merchant Foretta or Eteral (region set 2) can spawn.

### Wandering merchant : Island of Dawn

Mystery Merchants on Island of Dawn is an exception to the region sets, and spawn on a separate timer. Generally, Mystery Merchant **Vardung** spawns every 3-4 hours.

### Wandering merchant : City outskirts

Mystery Merchants around major cities is an exception to the region sets, and spawn on a separate timer. Generally, merchants spawn in order of Velika Outskirts, Allemantheia Outskirts, and Kaiator Outskirts with a 4-5 hour term in between spawns.

## Listings (wip)
Various items are sold by Mystery Merchants, and varies by region sets.

### 330 ground mounts
Mystery Merchants in Southern Arun (region set 1 and 2) sell ground mounts with movement speed of 330. At the time of this article update (v107.02), it is the fastest ground mount you can get. Wandering Merchants in each region sell differnt type of 330 mounts :

- Arcadia : **Beetle**- and **Wolf**-type mounts
- Val Aureum : **Pig**- and **Cat**-type mounts
- Poporia : **Struthio**- and **Car**-type mounts

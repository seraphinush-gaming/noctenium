Fishing is a casual open world activity. In order to catch fish, **Bait** and **Fishing Rod** are necessary. Both can be purchased with Gold from a [Fishing Supplies] merchant, and higher grade Fishing Rods and Baits can be exchanged with **Angler Tokens** from an [Angler Token Vendor].

[Fishing Supplies] merchant and [Angler Token Vendor] are located at fisheries and major cities.

Fish caught can be delivered to select NPCs for Gold or goods, or can be dismantled to obtain Fish Filet (Arborean Fish) or Kirash Filet (Exodor Fish) which can be used as Cooking materials.

**Fishing does not impact PvE or PvP.**

## Basics

With Bait and Fishing Rod in hand, players can head over to a fishery to start fishing. Before casting a fishing line with the Fishing Rod, Bait must be toggled on. This can be done through Inventory, players can right-click toggle to activate a bait - appropriate effect icon indicates that the bait is active. Once toggled on, players can right-click the Fishing Rod to cast a line. Fishing Rod can be right-click held to cast the line farther away.

Both Bait and Fishing Rod can be registered to a skill slot.

When a fish bites, players can press the interact key (default : F) to manually catch the fish, or wait a few minutes for the system to automatically catch the fish for you. Manual fishing is a lot quicker but requires more effort as difficulty increases with the grade of the fish.

## Manual fishing

![2]

In order to catch fish manually, players must play a **mini-game**. The key objective of the mini-game is to move the square on the left towards the reel on the right by reeling the fish appropriately within a time limit. Fish can be pulled to the right by holding the interact key (default : F) and Fish must overlap with the square in order to move it.

Difficulty of the mini-game increases relative to the grade of the fish to be caught - the square to shift to the right decreases in width, and the fish to be caught can resist more strongly and more often. 

Difficulty can be decreased using **Fish Salad**.

After manual fishing, the system does not recast the fishing line for the player.

## Automatic fishing

![3]

Instead of pressing the interact key (default : F) to manually fish, fishing can be automated when left idle for 3 minutes of auto-fishing time. After waiting and the fish is automatically caught, and the system recasts a fishing line. Players can switch to manual fishing at any point during the auto-fishing time.

Automatic fishing will continue until players runs out of bait or inventory is full.

Auto-fishing time can be reduced by using **Fairywing Rod**, or equipping **Angler's Whiskers** and **Card effects** from Card Collection.

Generally auto-fishing cannot catch BAF natively, and requires a Companion with **BAF Auto-Fishing** ability to be summoned.

## Big-A*s Fish

Rare fish called **BAF**, short for Big-A*s Fish have a rare chance to bite. BAF can be delivered to a Fish Associated Fishmonger NPC for at least 500 Gold.

There are several things that can increase the chance to catch a BAF :

- Ash Sapling Rod (item)
- Premium bait such as Popori Bait or Rainbow Bait (item)
- Clover's Luck (item)
- Backup Fisherman Gifted Skill (Companion)

## Fishing Rod

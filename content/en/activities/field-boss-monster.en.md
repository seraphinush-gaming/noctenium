Field Boss Monsters are large monsters in Open World. Currently there are 3 Field Boss Monsters - **Ortan**, **Hazard**, and **Cerrus** - all three spawn on **Arborea**.

In patch v86.01, Field Boss Monsters **Maknakh** and **Murderwing Monarch** was added. In patch v87.02, Maknakh and Murderwing Monarch was removed due to lag issues. In patch v96.01, Maknakh returned as part of Commander's Residence (20-Person) raid instance.

In patch v86.03, Field Boss Monster **LB-1** was added. In patch v87.02, LB-1 was removed due to lag issues. In patch v101.01, LB-1 returned as part of Commander's Residence (20-Person) raid instance.

In patch v86.05, Field Boss Monster **Azkan** was to be added but was indefinitely delayed to due lag issues.

In patch v90.01, **Rally Quest** to defeat Field Boss Monsters was added. In patch v91.01, Rally Quest to defeat Field Boss Monsters was changed back to previously existing Rally Quest to defeat named monsters.

## Lag issues

Similar to Nexus or Dreamstorm, large number of players concentrated in a small area exposed the 32bit client's inability to handle the overload of network packets and graphically rendering actions of over a hundred players, leading to client freezing until the surge of information decreased or disconnecting from the server. Several screenshots posted by TERA KR players showed more than half of the participating raid members disconnected from the server due to lag issues. As a result without being able to solve the issue, Field Boss Monster content on Exodor Archipelago was removed. 

## Spawn rate

Field Boss Monsters Ortan, Hazard, and Cerrus can spawn between 4hr 30min to 5hr 30min from their death.

## Reward

Rewards are distributed based on **individual contribution**. Participants receive either a **Raid Chest** or **Silver Raid Chest** depending on contribution and one participant dealing the last hit on the monster receives a special **Raid Golden Chest**. In addition, one random participant with at least minimum contribution receives **Treasure Chest**.

| Contribution | Chest |
| :-: | :-: |
| Low contribution | [Ortan | Hazard | Cerrus] Raid Chest |
| High Contribution | [Ortan | Hazard | Cerrus] Raid Silver Chest |
| Last hit | [Ortan | Hazard | Cerrus] Raid Golden Chest |
| Random jackpot | [Ortan | Hazard | Cerrus] Treasure Chest |

| Field Boss Monster | Raid Chest | Treasure Chest |

| Ortan | Skill Advancement Scroll | Skill Advancement Scroll III |
| Hazard | Relic | Amarun's Relic |
| Cerrus | Halidom | Ishara's Halidom |
